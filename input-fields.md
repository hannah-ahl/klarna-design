### Bordered vs borderless fields

Bordered fields should be used for flows where conversion play a big part, e.g. KCO, KP and Sofort. Borderless fields should be used for “home-base” interfaces such as the Klarna App and desktop interface, internal interfaces and styleguides.



Use bordered fields for **conversion sensitive** flows.



Use borderless fields for **in-product** flows.

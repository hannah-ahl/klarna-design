# Principles

#### Distilled / Refined
Content is king and the UI should not get in the way between the user and their goal.

#### Human and inclusive
Accessibility trumps unnecessary ornaments. We strive to create experiences where the brand is boosted where it can be.

#### Honest
The purpose of a flow and each of its steps should be straightforward, clear and leaving no doubt of what's happening, how and for how much. Copy, layout and design all aim in this direction.

#### Delightful
Micro-interactions, great copy and beautiful transitions to turn mundane interactions into playful and fun ones, giving a recognizable Klarna personality to the experience.

#### Bold
Confident, edgy and contemporary. Fresh, simple and clean, with a punch.

#### Fluid
Our interfaces can adapt to different brand volumes. Sometimes we'll take a step back when the content is the frontman, and others we'll boost the brand to take credit of the great things Klarna provides.

#### Smart and purposeful storytelling
We'll hold your hand and walk you through every step so you feel guided. We're on your side. We will not overwhelm. We want you to have to think as little as possible. We're here to help.

### Visual principles

(lines, flat, etc)

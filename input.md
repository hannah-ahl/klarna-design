# Input field

### Main field types

Regular, bordered fields should be used for flows where conversion plays a big part, e.g. KCO, KP and Sofort. Borderless fields should be used for “home-base” interfaces such as the Klarna App and desktop interface, internal interfaces and styleguides.

| Field | Guideline |
| :--- | :--- |
| ![](/assets/Field@1x.png) | Use regular fields for **conversion sensisive** flows. |
| ![](/assets/Input@1x.png) | Use borderless fields for **in-product** flows. |

### Variations

| Field | Guideline |
| :--- | :--- |
| ![]() | On background fields - same as regular fields (all states) but without the border |
| ![]() | Minimal fields - used in small-action cases where error handling and conversion isn't relevant, e.g. search bars and chat messaging |

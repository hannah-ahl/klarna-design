# Input fields

### Field type

Bordered fields should be used for flows where conversion play a big part, e.g. KCO, KP and Sofort. Borderless fields should be used for “home-base” interfaces such as the Klarna App and desktop interface, internal interfaces and styleguides.

| Component | Guideline |
| :--- | :--- |
| ![](/assets/Field@1x.png) | Use bordered fields for **conversion sensisive** flows. |
| ![](/assets/Input@1x.png) | Use borderless fields for **in-product** flows. |
